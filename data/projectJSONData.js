      "This is a full-stack web project still in progress! I'm working on a team of 4 in an Agile/Scrum environment. We have biweekly sprints to continue to add on functionality. The vision for this site is to be a time-sensitive and personalized homepage that offers useful functionality. Our focus is on tab-management and improving upon the browser's deficiencies in this regard. Instead of hoping to find what you're looking for through the the labyrinthine menus of the browser history, Flow just remembers what you closed and shows them to you in a nice and visual format. From here, the user can organize and categorize the tabs long after they've been closed. No more being afraid of closing browsers with an overwhelming amount of tabs!",

      "Just like my personal website you're on right now, Frustration was written in pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It works on both desktop and mobile (if mobile is detected, the ways to flip the cards change to be touch-friendly). It's a fun riff on the classic Memory/Concentration card game where flipping the cards is a little harder and a timer is ticking down. This app was fun for me to utilize some JavaScript basics and see how far I can push the basic DOM manipulation.",

      "This application is a long time coming. Initially, it was/is a mobile Android app that I made to solve a problem for myself. Building a Magic deck requires 20-30 specific land cards to support the other 20-30 cards you want to play. No other application uses the correct models to help choose those lands. Now, I'm working with a friend to make this into a full-fledged web-app to be more accessible. It isn't just for me, this is something the Magic community at large could use and we endeavor to make these complicated concepts easy to understand and use! For now though, the materials on this page will link to my initial Android application.",
