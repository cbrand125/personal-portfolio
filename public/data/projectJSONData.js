      "Since I help run a weekly series for League of Legends where teams are made up of drafted attendees, it quickly became apparent that there needs to be some way of tracking player statistics. This is a full-stack React/Express application meant to allow users to save their game results data under different tournament names. Then, that tournament can be shared and viewed by everyone to see a collection of player calculated player statistics and preferences. This has made for a lot better experience than the cumbersome spreadsheet we started with! This was also a great learning experience for using the Riot API!",

      "This is a full-stack web project I worked on with a small team in an Agile/Scrum environment. It was also my first foray into a Chrome Extension and those related technologies. Our focus was on tab-management and improving upon the browser's deficiencies in this regard. Instead of hoping to find what you're looking for through the the labyrinthine menus of the browser history, Flow just remembers what you closed and shows them to you in a nice and visual format. From here, the user can organize and categorize the tabs long after they've been closed. No more being afraid of closing browsers with an overwhelming amount of tabs!",

      "Just like my personal website you're on right now, Frustration was written in pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It works on both desktop and mobile (if mobile is detected, the ways to flip the cards change to be touch-friendly). It's a fun riff on the classic Memory/Concentration card game where flipping the cards is a little harder and a timer is ticking down. This app was fun for me to utilize some JavaScript basics and see how far I can push the basic DOM manipulation.",

      "This application is a long time coming. Initially, it was/is a mobile Android app that I made to solve a problem for myself. Now, it's a full-stack React application! Building a Magic deck requires 20-30 specific land cards to support the other 20-30 cards you want to play. No other application uses the correct models to help choose those lands. Now, I'm working with a friend to make this into a full-fledged web-app to be more accessible. It isn't just for me, this is something the Magic community at large could use and we endeavor to make these complicated concepts easy to understand and use!",
