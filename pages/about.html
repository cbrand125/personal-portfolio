    <section>
      <p>
        I'm a young professional software engineer with a passion for web (and
        by extension, mobile) development. As a forgetful person who finds ways
        to criticize every small inconvience in my daily life, I especially like
        to create applications that provide those much-needed conveniences! ðŸ™‚

        Aside from that, my interests lie mostly within travel, hiking, and
        online gaming:

          Here are some pictures from my trips to yadda, yadda, yadda. I liked
          yadda. I hiked yadda.

        <p>
          Online gaming is a huge passion of mine that consumes a lot of my
          time. I play a few online games and take them seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, I organized with a long-term group in Final Fantasy 14.
          We schedule, strategize, work, and adapt together to ensure that we
          are among the first groups to complete new and extremely difficult
          content. It's a highly stressful, competitive, and time-consuming
          environment. It all worth it, though: the teamwork and singular group
          focus to achieve a goal inspires me and the actual achievement thrills
          me.
