          I'm a full-stack software engineer with a passion for web (and by
          extension, mobile) development. As a forgetful person who finds ways
          to criticize every small inconvience in my daily life, I especially
          like to create applications that provide those much-needed
          conveniences! ðŸ™‚

          Aside from that, my interests lie mostly within travel, hiking, and
          online gaming
        </h3>
        <section class="interestBlurb">
          <h4>Travel & Hiking</h4>

          <p>
            I recently travelled to Tokyo and Seville. It's really become a
            passion to visit new places; I've met lifelong friends in every
            place I've been and learned things I'll never forget. The only
            difficulty with travel is balancing wanting to return and wanting to
            go someplace new!
          </p>
          <p>
            I also recently hiked the most gorgeous place I've ever been,
            Yosemite. I don't always get to hike such high-profile natural
            landmarks, but I try to get out to see local sights as often as
            possible. It's really a necessity for me to get away and disconnect
            every once in a while.

          <h4>Gaming</h4>
          <img src="/images/ff14.jpg" alt="Final Fantasy 14" />
          <img src="/images/wow.jpg" alt="World of Warcraft" />
          <img src="/images/lol.jpg" alt="League of Legends" />
          <p>
            Online gaming is a huge passion of mine that consumes a lot of my
            time. I play a few online games and take them seriously.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, I organized with a long-term group in Final Fantasy 14.
            We schedule, strategize, work, and adapt together to ensure that we
            are among the first groups to complete new and extremely difficult
            content. It's a highly stressful, competitive, and time-consuming
            environment. It all worth it, though: the teamwork and singular
            group focus to achieve a goal inspires me and the actual achievement
            thrills me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've played Warcraft for most of my life. It's where I met my best
            friends (one of which I live with now), where I learned to
            communicate with and organize large groups of people and where I
            learned the value of a community.
          </p>
          <p>
            League of Legends has been with me for years and years as well, but
            I don't regret any of my time on it. It's been a masterclass in
            self-reflection and improvement. With a highly competitive
            environment involving teams and an evaluation system, it can be
            really hard to evaluate and analyze your own gameplay in a
            meaningful way. Your own and other peoples' emotions and pride get
            in the way. But when I'm able to see past that, and take feedback
            from myself and others, I'm able to improve at this ridiculously
            difficult game!
