      "This is a project still in progress! I'm working on a team of 4 in an Agile/Scrum environment. We have biweekly sprints to continue to add on functionality. The vision for this site is to be a time-sensitive and personalized homepage that offers useful functionality. Our focus is on tab-management and improving upon the browser's deficiencies in this regard. Instead of hoping to find what you're looking for through the the labyrinthine menus of the browser history, Flow just remembers what you closed and shows them to you in a nice and visual format. From here, the user can organize and categorize the tabs long after they've been closed. No more being afraid of closing browsers with an overwhelming amount of tabs!",
